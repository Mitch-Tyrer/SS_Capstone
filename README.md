# SS_Capstone

As part of our final project we were split into teams of 4 and presented with a simulated real-world scenario in which we would apply all that we had learned in our 20 week program.  I was designated the team lead or "Director of IT" and was in charge if delegating tasks assigned to us, compiling and normalizing all documentation, and help team members with tasks to meet the goals of the directives. 

For this excercise we were given a virtual lab environment of a network as well as guidance in the form of emails from the CISO. Everything presented here is the final presentation and a complete compiliation of the documentation we created for each part of this project, in the order in which they were completed. All recommendations, remediations, and anaylization is of that virtual enviornment and simulated logs provided to us. 

## The Scenario

Recently a company (ACME) suffered a major data breach due to negligence and poor security practices.  In the aftermath their current Cheif Information Security Officer (CISO) resigned over the incident forcing ACME to hire a new CISO to help remediate the data breach.  His first directive was to replace the third-party Security Operations Center (SOC) with his own internal team hiring each us for those roles within ACME.

Our task was to investigate the attack, analyze the current state of ACME's systems and networks, and to create a security brief based on our CISO's directives.  This security brief should be in the form of a slide show presentation, which we would present to ACME Administrators/Managers in 10 days.


## What is in this repo

Here are the two final documents I submited as the "Director of IT" for my team.  To view them will require a means to view a PowerPoint Presentation and Word Document
